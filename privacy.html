        Hello! My name is <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/George-Spanos">George</a> and I created Boochat.
        Boochat is chat and meetups application developed exclusively for internal usage. I developed (and still
        developing)
        it to mess around with
        new technologies, learning new stuff while creating something of relative value for my friends. This app is
        <b>never</b> going to be accessible to the public. Only
        specific people have a right to create an account and access the app via directly sharing their email to me. The
        same applies for both web and mobile version of the app.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>In terms of data protection and privacy</b>, every connection in encrypted and the app saves the least amount
        of data needed for it to provide its' features. This includes
    <ul>
        <li>Usernames</li>
        <li>User Profile Images</li>
        <li>Messages</li>
        <li>Meetup Attendance (either digital or physical)</li>
        <li>Voting on Polls</li>
    </ul>
    <i>
        Everyone who has shared his email with me for using the app has agreed to let the app save the appropriate
        pieces of information for providing it's set of features. Data is not shared with any 3rd party or used for any
        other purpose rather than providing the mandatory in-app features of a "Chat and Meetups" application.
